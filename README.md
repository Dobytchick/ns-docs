# ns-docs
This is the Nutscript documentation repo. All you need to do is create a folder (for a category) and a file (this will be a page/section).
Each category can handle multiple pages/sections. Use GitHub markdown in .md the page/section files (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Note: Each category will automatically populate with a table of contents, so don't worry about that.
Also, try to keep a uniform style please. No giant headers where they are not necessary. A section header will automatically populate.

## Categories
When you make a folder on the repo, it will create a category on the website:

## Pages
When you make file (!! must be .md for markdown !!) in the category folder, that file will be displayed on the website.
